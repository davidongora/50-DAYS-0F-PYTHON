# 50-DAYS-0F-PYTHON
This is a 50-day challenge of python exercise that covers all the challenges using python languange.
the challenges are:

Day 1: 
    Division and Square-root 
        Write a function called divide_or_square that takes one argument (a number), and returns the square root of the number if it is divisible by 5, returns its remainder if it is not divisible by 5. For example, if you pass 10 as an argument, then your function should return 3.16 as the square root.


    Extra Challenge: Longest Value
        Extra Challenge: Longest Value
        Write a function called longest_value that takes a dictionary as an argument and returns the first longest value of the dictionary. For example, the following dictionary should return – apple as the longest value.
        fruits = {'fruit': 'apple', 'color': 'green'}

Day 2:
     Strings to Integers Extra Challenge:
     Write a function called convert_add that takes a list of strings as an argument and converts it to integers and sums the list. For example [‘1’, ‘3’, ‘5’] should be converted to [1, 3, 5] and summed to 9.

      Duplicate Names
        Extra Challenge: Duplicate Names
        Write a function called check_duplicates that takes a list of strings as an argument. The function should check if the list has any duplicates. If there are duplicates, the function should return the duplicates. If there are no duplicates, the function should return "No duplicates". For example, the list of fruits below should return apple as a duplicate and list of names should return "no duplicates".
        fruits = ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'apple'] names = ['Yoda', 'Moses', 'Joshua', 'Mark']



Day 3: 
    Register Check
    Write a function called register_check that checks how many students are in school. The function takes a dictionary as a parameter. If the student is in school, the dictionary says ‘yes’. If the student is not in school, the dictionary says ‘no’. Your function should return the number of students in school. Use the dictionary below. Your function should return 3.

    
    
    Extra Challenge:
     Lowercase Names

    You are given a list of names above. This list is made up of names of lowercase and uppercase letters. Your task is to write a code that will return a tuple of all the names in the list that have only lowercase letters. Your tuple should have names sorted alphabetically in descending order. Using the list above, your code should return:
    ('kerry', 'dickson', 'carol', 'adam')

Day 4: 
    Only Floats Extra Challenge:

    Write a function called only_floats, which takes two parameters a and b, and returns 2 if both arguments are floats, returns 1 if only one argument is a float, and returns 0 if neither argument is a float. If you pass (12.1, 23) as an argument, your function should return a 1.



    Index of the Longest Word

    Write a function called word_index that takes one argument, a list of strings and returns the index of the longest word in the list. If there is no longest word (if all the strings are of the same length), the function should return zero (0). For example, the list below should return 2.
    words1 = ["Hate", "remorse", "vengeance"] And this list below, shoul return zero (0)
    words2 = ["Love", "Hate"]



Day 5: 
    My Discount 
    Create a function called my_discount. The function takes no arguments but asks the user to input the price and the discount (percentage) of the product. Once the user inputs the price and discount, it calculates the price after the discount. The function should return the price after the discount. For example, if the user enters 150 as price and 15% as the discount, your function should return 127.5.

    
    
    
    Extra Challenge: 
    Tuple of Student Sex
    You work for a school and your boss wants to know how many female and male students are enrolled in the school. The school has saved the students in a list. Your task is to write a code that will count how many males and females are in the list. Here is a list below:
    students = ['Male', 'Female', 'female', 'male', 'male', 'male', 'female', 'male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'female']
    Your code should return a list of tuples. The list above should return:
    [(‘Male’,7), (‘female’,6)]

Day 6:
     User Name Generator

Write a function called user_name that generates a username from the user’s email. The code should ask the user to input an email and the code should return everything before the @ sign as their user name. For example, if someone enters ben@gmail.com, the code should return ben as their user name.

    Extra Challenge: Zero Both ends

    Write a function called zeroed code that takes a list of numbers as an argument. The code should zero (0) the first and the last number in the list. For example, if the input is [2, 5, 7, 8, 9], your code should return [0, 5, 7, 8, 0].

Day 7: 
    A String Range 
    Write a function called string_range that takes a single number and returns a string of its range. The string characters should be separated by dots(.) For example, if you pass 6 as an argument, your function should return ‘0.1.2.3.4.5’.
    
    
    
    Extra Challenge: 
    Dictionary of names

    You are given a list of names, and you are asked to write a code that returns all the names that start with ‘S’. Your code should return a dictionary of all the names that start with S and how many times they appear in the dictionary. Here is a list below:
    names = ["Joseph","Nathan", "Sasha", "Kelly", "Muhammad", "Jabulani", "Sera”, "Patel", "Sera”]
    Your code should return: {“Sasha”: 1, “Sera”: 2}

Day 8:
     Odd and Even 
     Write a function called odd_even that has one parameter and takes a list of numbers as an argument. The function returns the difference between the largest even number in the list and the smallest odd number in the list. For example, if you pass [1,2,4,6] as an argument the function should return 6 -1= 5.

     Extra Challenge: Reversed List

str1 = 'leArning is hard, bUt if You appLy youRself ' \ 'you can achieVe success'
 You are given a string of words. Some of the words in the string contain uppercase letters. Write a code that will return all the words that have an uppercase letter. Your code should return a list of the words. Each word in the list should be reversed. Here is how your output should look:
['gninrAel', 'tUb', 'uoY', 'yLppa', 'flesRuoy', 'eVeihca']
  
Day 21:
    Write a function called make_tuples that takes two lists, equal lists, and combines them into a list of tuples. For example, if list a is [1,2,3,4] and list b is [5,6,7,8], your function should return [(1,5), (2,6), (3,7), (4,8)].

Extra Challenge: Even Number or Average
Write a function called even_or_average that ask a user to input five numbers. Once the user is done, the code should return the largest even number in the inputted numbers. If there is no even number in the list, the code should return the average of all the five numbers.
